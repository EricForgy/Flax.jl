# Genie / Flax
#### Flax is the templating engine of Genie.jl, the highly productive Julia web framework.

Flax is HTML based, with simple interpolated Julia code blocks and string interpolation.

The Flax templates are also highly optimized, as they are transpiled on the fly into Julia code and compiled. 

At the moment Flax does not work outside Genie.

Documentation pending.
